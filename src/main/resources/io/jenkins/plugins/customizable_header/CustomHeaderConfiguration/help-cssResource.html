<div>
    If you need full control over the styling of the header you can specify here the url to your own css file.
    The url can be an absolute url or a file path inside the root directory of Jenkins.<br/>
    Typically, you want to put this in the folder <em>userContent</em> in your <em>JENKINS_HOME</em> directory.
    Paths outside the Jenkins root directory are not allowed for security reasons.
