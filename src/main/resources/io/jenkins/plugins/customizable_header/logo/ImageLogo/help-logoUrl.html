  The url can either be an absolute http/https url or a path inside <em>JENKINS_HOME/userContent/</em>. Path outside this directory are not allowed for
  security reasons. For backward compatibility path starting with <em>[/]userContent/</em> are also possible.<br/>
  Do not use the absolute url <em>&lt;jenkins_url&gt;/userContent/...</em> as the plugin would try to download the file from Jenkins as <em>anonymous</em>
  user which will fail if <em>anonymous</em> has no <em>Overall/Read</em> permissions.
