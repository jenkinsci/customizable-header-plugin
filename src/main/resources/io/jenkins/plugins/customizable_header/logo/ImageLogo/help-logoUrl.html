  The url can either be an absolute http/https url or path relative to the Jenkins root directory (JENKINS_HOME). Typically, you want to put the file
  in the <em>userContent</em> folder in your <em>JENKINS_HOME</em> directory.

  which will likely fail if <em>anonymous</em> has no <em>Overall/Read</em> permissions.
